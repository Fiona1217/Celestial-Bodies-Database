# Galaxy Database Project ðŸ’«
## Overview
This project involves the creation and management of a PostgreSQL database designed to store and analyze data related to galaxies, planets, moons, stars, and their types. The database features tables for galaxies, planets, moons, and stars, facilitating various queries to derive insights into the universe's structure.

## Key Learnings
### Database Design
Understanding the significance of structuring tables effectively to support efficient data storage and retrieval. The design incorporates foreign keys to establish relationships between galaxies, stars, and planets, ensuring data integrity.

### SQL Queries
Gaining proficiency in SQL by executing various queries to extract valuable statistics. This includes calculating the number of celestial bodies, their characteristics, and relationships using aggregate functions such as COUNT, AVG, and SUM.

### Data Manipulation
Learning how to insert, update, and manage data within the database. This includes truncating tables for fresh data imports and implementing integrity checks to ensure data accuracy.

### Error Handling
Encountering and resolving common SQL errors, such as syntax errors and issues with JOIN statements, which has enhanced problem-solving skills and attention to detail.

### Data Analysis
Utilizing SQL to derive meaningful insights, such as identifying which galaxies contain the most planets or which stars belong to specific types, thus facilitating a deeper understanding of cosmic structures.

### Bash Scripting
Implementing shell scripts to automate database interactions and data management tasks, showcasing how scripting can streamline workflows and enhance efficiency.
